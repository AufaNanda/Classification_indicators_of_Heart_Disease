# Classification_indicators_of_Heart_Disease
Heart disease is a condition that can affect all living beings and may occur due to obesity or hereditary factors. The medical field has advanced alongside the times, providing numerous indicators of heart disease that can help prevent or minimize its occurrence. This project aims to classify heart disease risk using various machine learning methods to determine the best approach for predicting its indicators.

# Objective
- Perform data preprocessing, including normalization and cleaning, to ensure it is suitable for machine learning models.
- Build machine learning models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost Classifier.
- Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Predict symptoms of heart disease.
- Compare classification algorithms to identify the most effective one.
